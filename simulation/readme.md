This folder is for simulating the kalman filter depending on the parameters from openrocket. the main idea was to simulate the plots and outputs before we deploy it on the arduino on the rocket. 

```
If you want to see the both plots from sensors and only acc run "final_kalman.py"


Once the kalman is ready to use, it will be deployed on the arduino with .ino file
